**Benefits of UV:**
 - Significantly faster package installation and environment setup
 - Built-in dependency resolution and locking
 - Integrated caching for improved CI performance
 - Drop-in replacement for pip workflows

**Transformations applied:**
 - `actions/setup-python@v5` → `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6`
 - `cache: 'pip'` → `enable-cache: 'true'`
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `uv sync` (configurable strategy)
 - `python -m <module>` → `uv run <module>`
 - Removes unnecessary `pip install --upgrade pip` steps

**Sync strategies:**
 - `basic`: Basic synchronization (`uv sync`)
 - `locked`: Use locked dependencies (`uv sync --locked`)
 - `full`: Install all extras and dev dependencies (`uv sync --all-extras --dev`)
